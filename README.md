## üßê What's that?

This is my personal blog available on [matjanowski.pl](https://www.blog.matjanowski.pl), created with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). Here I share  tutorials or technical challenges I faced recently and my thoughts about IT in general.  

## üí¨ Comments

I use GitHub issues to track dicussion under my blog posts. My inspiration came from [@schooletz's blog](https://blog.scooletz.com/). He used GitHub to allow others to contricute his articles, but I extended this concept with comments. 

Please feel free to contribute either with a Pull Request or any feedback using GH.
